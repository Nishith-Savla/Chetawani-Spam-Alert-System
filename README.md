# Chetawani - The Spam Alert System of the new age

Chetawani is a spam alert system that utilizes both crowd sourcing and machine learning to detect spam messages. The system is designed to work through a mobile application and has three main processes for spam filtering: phone call spam detection, email spam detection, and SMS spam detection.

For phone call spam detection, the user will decide whether an incoming call is spam or not. This information will then be crowdsourced in the system's database for further usage. The user will also be notified whether the incoming call is spam or not.

For email spam detection, the system uses a machine learning model to determine whether an incoming message is spam or not. The result is then notified to the user, and the information is also crowdsourced in the database to train the model periodically for more accurate results. The system also provides a risk score for the email, which is calculated using another machine learning model.

For SMS spam detection, another machine learning model is utilized to determine whether an incoming message is spam or not. The result is then notified to the user, and the information is also crowdsourced in the database.

Overall, Chetawani is a comprehensive spam alert system that utilizes both crowd sourcing and machine learning to provide users with accurate spam detection for various types of communication channels.
